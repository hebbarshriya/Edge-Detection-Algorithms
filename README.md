# EDGE DETECTION ALGORITHMS

#### Introduction
Edge detection is a fundamental operation in image analysis, critical for object recognition, image segmentation, and feature extraction. This project explores and compares several edge detection algorithms implemented using CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) to leverage the parallel processing power of GPUs. The algorithms evaluated in this project include the Sobel, Prewitt, Scharr, and Roberts operators.

#### Problem Statement
The main goal of this project is to evaluate the performance of different edge detection algorithms in terms of accuracy, computational efficiency, and robustness to noise. By implementing these algorithms on GPUs using CUDA, we aim to determine which algorithm provides the best balance of speed and accuracy for edge detection tasks in image processing.

#### Project Overview
This project involves the following steps:
1. Implementing edge detection algorithms (Sobel, Prewitt, Scharr, and Roberts) using CUDA.
2. Comparing the performance of these algorithms based on execution time and edge detection quality.
3. Using Google Colab for execution due to the lack of local CUDA-enabled GPUs.

#### Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of edge detection and image processing.
- Familiarity with CUDA and parallel programming concepts.
- Access to a CUDA-enabled GPU (or Google Colab for cloud-based GPU access).
- Necessary software: NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit, a C compiler, and the STB library for image handling.

#### Methodology
1. Loading and Preprocessing: Load the input image and convert it to grayscale using the STB library.
2. CUDA Kernel Implementation: Implement each edge detection algorithm as a separate CUDA kernel function. These functions will process image data in parallel, assigning threads to individual pixels.
3. Performance Measurement: Use CUDA events to measure the execution time of each kernel, calculating the elapsed time for processing.
4. Output Evaluation: Save the output images generated by each algorithm and visually assess the edge detection quality.

#### Discussion
The experimental results demonstrate the advantages of using CUDA for edge detection. The Roberts filter exhibited the shortest execution time, with the Scharr, Prewitt, and Sobel filters following closely. All algorithms completed edge detection tasks efficiently, highlighting the effectiveness of GPU acceleration for parallelizable tasks in image processing.

#### Future Work
Future enhancements to this project could include:
- Implementing additional edge detection algorithms and comparing their performance.
- Exploring optimization techniques to further improve the efficiency of CUDA implementations.
- Extending the evaluation to different types of images and more complex datasets.
- Investigating the impact of various CUDA configurations and hardware setups on performance.

#### Conclusion
This project successfully implemented and compared several edge detection algorithms using CUDA, demonstrating significant improvements in processing time and efficiency. The results highlight the potential of GPU acceleration for computationally intensive tasks in image processing.
